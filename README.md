# JAVALoansandInterestRates
Java Program that determines interest rates based on loan amount payments.

Write a program that lets the user enter the loan amount and loan period in number of years and displays the monthly and total payments for each interest rate starting from 5% to 8% with an increment of 1/8. 
Here is the formula to compute monthly payment: 

M = ( P  *  r ) /  (1- Math.pow ( 1.0 + r , n * -12.0))           
P = Principle,           
r = rate per period
n = number of periods
